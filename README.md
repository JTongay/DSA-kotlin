# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction
It's been a while since I have brushed up on some fundamentals, so here we go. 
This is written in Kotlin because:
- I really love the language
- I miss using it when I worked in a Native Android codebase 
- I would like to get more reps on Spring Boot w/ Kotlin, so need to dust off my Kotlin chops a bit

Some of the fundamentals covered will include:
- Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs
- Heaps
- Recursion
- Tree Traversal
- Sorting Algorithms

All of these concepts will include tests as well!

There will also be NO COPILOT here
